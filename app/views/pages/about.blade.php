   Book Rental is an online community to create your own library from the collection of great book collections we have at home.
    <br> This currently is designed only for children books maintained by adults.
   How it works?
            Add the books you are ready for rent.
            Browse books from the list to see if you are interested in renting a book.
            Rent the book.
            Owner gets an email with your address details
            Owner sends the book to your address
            Once you are complete with the book
            Go to initiate return in the Books I have rented.
            Renter gets an email with the owner's address details
            Owner should make the book available as soon as the book reaches.
            After 5 days of renter initiation owner gets an email requesting the user to update.
